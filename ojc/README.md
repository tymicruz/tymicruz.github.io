 A webpage I made to showcase my friends when we called ourselves the Orange Juice Crew aka OJC ... (lol) I was just learning.

 I always loved seeing my creativity come to life in a webpage even though my skills are undeveloped. More development to come in this area! I'm now learning React <3 and blockchain development <3 (2022 edit). Those projects should be up on Github soon ...
